How to package the maven project:
Use command:
./mvnw package
And then to run the jar package the command is:
java -cp target/tut-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.jobriedupreez.tut.App
---------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:My tut is unfortunately not working, because I kept on getting
noclassdeffounderror when trying to import external libraries, however I know I
installed them and the maven build was succesful, but yeah :(
Therefore I've barely got any code for the problem.
